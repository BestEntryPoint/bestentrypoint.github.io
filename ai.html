<div class="d"><br>
<font0>
We believe that the most hard thing in starting anything is to do the first step. We want to make this step being for you really easy. Totally!	
<br><br>
Hopefully, it is the first easily understandable book on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for all girls and boys age 8+. Also, of course, the best entry point for anyone more adult who wants to start understanding of AI and eventually to be capable to create super powerful AIs.
<br><br>
By the way, we practice <b>redundancy</b> throughout this book, using very simple words and explaining the same things several times.

<fontHeading><center>What is AI?</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
Things are changing fast.
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="city1.png" width= 100%>
</center>
<br>
At a huge pace, we are going to a world where people will have an augmented minds. Where a person will have their human mind completed with endless capabilities of an artificial mind -- in othr words, with endless capabilities of a machine mind.
<br><br>
For now, we, in a way, have already had sort of augmented minds. Since we can resort to the help of machines while thinking. For example, we can already augmente our Minds with additional capabilitie while, for example, doing calculations by using calculators being in our devices: smartphones, tablets or laptops.
<br><br>
Calculators were the first versions of Artificial Minds.
<br><br>
But people wanted more. And they finally created THE more.
<br><br>
So people now are able to build Artificial Minds that may be self-learning. 
<br><br>
For now people can already create Artificial Minds which literally can on its own learn from facts of life and <b>can be becoming better</b> throughout this self-learning process. Yes, Artificial Minds now can be learning and becoming better entirely on their own.
<br><br>
So only an Artificial Mind that can be learning on its own is considered now as a modern AI — and is called Artificial Neural Network, or just <b>Neural Network</b> (NN) for short.
<br><br>
In the future, we will not even need to type something on the keyboard — for example, to type some numbers for doing calculations —  since it will be enough for us to just think of it.
<br><br>
It will inevitably be so since it is possible for people — a proven scientific fact — to use their thoughts to control diverse devices, either a computer or a robot, or even a machine mind with endless capabilities.
<br><br>
That's where everything is heading.

At the first step, we will look at the simplest case when all the 3 rectangle lamps act together: pic for a gray pixel.
<br><br>
Such one-color pixel may show 256 diffrent colors in a so-called crayscale way.
<br><br>
-- the absolut white color = 255:<br>
<br><br>

<br>
-- the absolut black color = 0:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="absblack.png" height = 100%>
</center>
<br>
Plus, 254 colors representing 254 shades of gray. Really, 254 shades of gray = 1 to 254 inclusive:

</center>
<br>
<br><br>
in the field of AI
<br><br>
Of course, Multipliers are just numbers. Just numbers like 3, 5, 0.7 or - 9, for example.
<br><br>
Just imagine for a second that the machine doesn't undestand what means Input1 equal to 5, what means Input2 equal to 3 and,  of course, what means Input3 equal to 3. The machine doesn't understand that it all is about partying. Absolutely.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the machine easily calculates proper Multipliers. It is so because we first gave it our expected Outputs for different Cases.
<br><br>
This awesome conclusion opens up great prospects for building Neural Networks.

<br><br>
So, since a machine doesn't understand what it all is about — then while training — we can feed the machine any numbers about anything if we simultaneously give it our expected Outputs for different Cases.

<br><br>
For now, just let's notice this.

<br><br>
some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 & 1 and
<br><br>
Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="sigm.png" width = 100%>
</center>
<br>
Organize all our Inputs from one layer into a row ( as a vector). from that layer of Inputs into a row of numbers arranged this way.
And let's do the same with our Multipliers -- which are just some numbers (0.1, 0.1, -0.1).
<br><br>
<br><br>
You literally should play around with that simple example of partying. To get the feel -- get a sense -- of how AI works with simple tasks. 
<br><br>
To get the feel -- get a sense -- of the elemantary elements of AI.
<br><br>
Since any more complicated task is just solved by compination of such elemantary elements.
 <br><br>
<br><br>
</font0>

<fontHeading><center>Our first goal</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
As our 1-st goal let's create an Artificial Intelligence —  Artificial Neural Network — that would help you decide either you go at some specific party or not.
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ai.png" height= 300px>
</center>
<br>
So within just minutes you will become able to create your first Artificial Neural Network that works. 
<br><br>
</font0>


<fontHeading><center>Simplest Math
</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
If you know math a little bit, you can skip this part over and go right away to the part <b style="color: #FF703E">Fast Start</b> which is <a href="book6.html#FastStart">here</a>.
<br><br>


Imagine that you got 3 friends and you want to give 2 oranges to each friend.
<br><br>
How many oranges do you need?
<br><br>
Here we go:
<br><br>
<b>3(friends) * 2(oranges) = 6 oranges</b>
<br><br>
Okay, it is easy.
<br><br>
Imagine that you got 4 friends and you want to also give 2 oranges to each friend.
<br><br>
How many oranges do you need?
<br><br>
Here we go:
<br><br>
<b>4(friends) * 2(oranges) = 8 oranges</b>
<br><br>
So the formula to calculate oranges will be as follows:
<br><br>
<b>formula = friends * oranges</b>
<br><br>
So we might say that a formula is a method of doing something.
<br><br>
Or, in our case, a formula is a method of calculating something.
<br><br>
Imagine that your State (the USA, UK, Canada or any other one) gives you, as a gift, some coins every day. During each month. Such a good state.
<br><br>
The number of coins you get every specific day is calculated with some formula.
<br><br>
So you get:
<br><br>
<b>
1st day = 1 * 1 = 1 coin<br>
2nd day = 2 * 2 = 4 coins<br>
3rd day = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 coins<br>
4th day = 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256 coins<br></b>
....<br>
and so on.
<br><br>
We might also represent this aproach this way:
<br><br><b>
1st day = 1 * 1 = <b>1<sup>1</sup></b> = 1 coin<br>
2nd day = 2 * 2 = <b>2<sup>2</sup></b> = 4 coins<br>
3rd day = 3 * 3 * 3 = <b>3<sup>3</sup></b> = 27 coins<br>
4th day = 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = <b>4<sup>4</sup></b> = 256 coins<br></b>
....<br>
and so on.
<br><br>
So we might say that the formula used by the State looks like this:
<br><br><b>
coins = day<sup>day</sup></b>
<br><br>
It is easy.
<br><br>

There are 2 sorts of activities any AI can do:<br>
· be working — be giving out its thoughts;<br>
· be self-learning.<br>
<br>
We will first take a look at how AI is working.
<br><br>
So we're going to build probably the simplest AI that would provide you with its <b>recommendation</b> of either going to some specific party, or staying home.
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="party.png" width= "100%">
</center>
<br>
Let's get started.
<br><br>
Suppose that for some reasons, you have the following preferences about spontaneous parties:<br>
· you always go to a party if there is your best <b>friend</b> and it is not <b>raining</b> — regardless of whether there is your favorite <b>cocktail</b> or not:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="friends_1.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="rain_0.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="cocktails_3.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
· you always go to a party if there is your favorite <b>cocktail</b> and it is not <b>raining</b> — regardless of whether there is your best <b>friend</b> or not:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="cocktails_1.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="rain_0.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="friends_3.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
· but if it is <b>raining</b> you always go to a party only if there are both your best <b>friend</b> and your favorite <b>cocktail</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="rain_1.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="friends_1.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="cocktails_1.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
As we know, machines love to work with numbers.
<br><br>
For this reason, let's convert (turn) each <b>yes</b> into <b>5</b> and each <b>no</b> into <b>3</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="53.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
Of course, this might be any 2 numbers instead of the <b>5</b> and <b>3</b> — for example, 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 3 and 7, and so on — but we, say at random or for some reason, have chosen the numbers <b>5</b> and <b>3</b>.
<br><br>
Okay.
<br><br>

From now what we will do exactly is we will always:<br>
· convert the fact that there is your best friend into <b>5</b> and the fact that there isn't your best friend into <b>3</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="friends1.png" height= 150px><br>
<img src="friends0.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
· convert the fact that there is your favorite cocktail into <b>5</b> and the fact that there isn't your favorite cocktail into <b>3</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="cocktails1.png" height= 150px><br>
<img src="cocktails0.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
· convert  the fact that it is raining into <b>5</b> and the fact that there is no rain into <b>3</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="rain1.png" height= 150px><br>
<img src="rain0.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
Easy!
<br><br>
So by this simple trick we made the computer capable to understand our human life absolutely well.
<br><br>
It is just great.
<br><br>
So, for example, if we know that at the party there <b>is</b> your best <b>friend</b>, there <b>isn't</b> your favorite <b>cocktail</b> and it <b>isn’t raining</b> then we get the following:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="friends1.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="cocktails0.png" height= 150px>&nbsp
<img src="rain0.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
In programming, such facts of life converted into numbers — either into 5 or into 2, for example — are called <b>Inputs</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="case1.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
Input1 = 5<br>
Input2 = 5<br>
Input3 = 5<br>
<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
Next, the machine has to multiply each Input by an individual Multiplier:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="multiplier_clear.png" height= 400px>
</center>
As we can see, the Multipliers are as follows:
<br><br>
<center>
Multiplier1&nbsp=&nbsp0.1&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMultiplier2&nbsp=&nbsp0.1&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMultiplier3 =&nbsp-0.1<br></center>
<br>
So, we may get the Product1, Product2 and Product3:
<br><br>
Product1 = Input1 * Multiplier1 = 5 * 0.1 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp= &nbsp0.5<br>
Product2 = Input2 * Multiplier2 = 3 * 0.1 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      = &nbsp0.3<br>
Product3 = Input3 * Multiplier3 = 3 * (-0.1) = -0.3<br>
<br>
These Multipliers (0.1, 0.1, -0.1) are very important in work of our AI. 
<br><br>
These Multipliers (0.1, 0.1, -0.1) are very important since, as we will see further, precisely they do the most work while making the recommendation.
<br><br>
<!--
So, each Input has its own Multiplier showing the size of the Input's contribution into the recommendation.
<br><br>
In other words, each Multiplier shows the degree of importance of the Input while making the recommendation. 
<br><br>
-->
For educational purposes we got these Multipliers ready-made but in real life, <b>as we will see very soon</b>, calculating such Multipliers — one Multiplier for each Input  — is the most important task while building any AI.
<br><br>
Calculating such Multipliers is THE challenge while building any AI.
<br><br>
Anyway, for educational purposes, let's suppose that we have already been given these Multipliers:
<br>
Multiplier1 = &nbsp0.1<br>
Multiplier2 = &nbsp0.1<br>
Multiplier3 = -0.1<br>
<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
Next, as we can see below, the machine sums all the Products:<br><br>




<center>
<img src="sum.png" height= 400px>
</center>
<br>

Since:
<br><br>
Product1 = &nbsp0.5<br>
Product2 = &nbsp0.3<br>
Product3 = -0.3<br>
<br>
Then:
<br><br>
Sum = Product1 + Product2 + Product3 = 0.5 + 0.3 - 0.3 = 0.5
<br><br>
So, <b>Sum</b> = 0.5.
<br><br>
Pay attention, when we say <b>Sum</b> we always imply precisely <b>Sum of our Products</b> — for example, Product1 + Product2 + Product3.
<br><br>
So, <b>Sum of our Products</b> — or <b>Sum</b> for short — equals 0.5.
<br><br>

Next, the machine puts our Sum into a <b>Main Formula</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ai_mf.png" width= "70%">
</center>
<br>
So if whenever our Sum is equal to or more than 0.5, then our Main Formula gives out <b>1</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ai_mf_1.png" width= "70%">
</center>
<br>
which can be converted by us into the phrase — I'd like to recommend you to GO to the party, my host; or <b>GO</b> for short.
<br><br>
But else  (for example, if whenever our Sum has been equal to 10), then our Main Formula gives out <b>0</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ai_mf_0.png" width= "70%">
</center>
<br>
which can be converted by us into the phrase — I'd like to recommend you to STAY home, my host; or <b>STAY</b> for short.
<br><br>
As we can see, everything is easy!
<br><br>
So, according to our Main Formula, since our Sum is equal to 0.5, it means the Sum meets the condition that <b>If our Sum is equal to or more than 0.5</b> so the machine gives out <b>1</b>:

<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ai_full.png" width= "80%">
</center>
<br>
which are converted by us into <b>GO</b>.
<br><br>
Of course, when other Case happens to be there — when other Inputs happen to be there —  then the recommendation may be completely other.
<br><br>
It is exactly the way how any AI works.
<br><br>
For now, you need to understand just 4 things.
<br><br>
<b>The 1st thing</b><br>
There are some Inputs — some facts of life converted into numbers — 5 or 3, for example.
<br><br>
<b>The 2nd thing</b><br>
There is some Multipliers — one Multiplier for each Input — 0.1, 0.1, -0.1, for example.
<br><br>
<b>The 3rd thing</b><br>
There is some Sum of Products that is calculated by multiplying each Input with its own Multiplier and next summing all the Products — 0.5, for example.
<br><br>
<b>The 4th thing</b><br>
There is some Main Formula (using the Sum) by which the machine gives its recommendation, either 1 or 0 — 1, for example.
<br><br>

Back to our AI.
<!--
Since machines love to work with numbers, it would be just convenient if each of its recommendations would be represented by some number.
-->
<br><br>
What is a neuron in this system?  We can see that from the picture below:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="neuron.png" width= "80%">
</center>
<br>
People call the orange field in the system an artificial neuron, or just <b>neuron</b> for short.
<br><br>
So our simplest AI — the simplest Neural Network -- consists of just one Neuron:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="neuron0.png" width= "50%">
</center>
<br>
If you do not know anything about Neurons it is absolutely okay and there is not any need to know something about them.
<br><br>
<br><br>



As we can see, our Neuron eats the following numbers: 5, 3, 3 and then shits out the number <b>1</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="eats.png" height=400px>
</center>
<br>
Similarly, any Neuron on Earth eats something (5, 3, 3 — for example) and then shits out something (<b>1</b> — for example).<br>
<br>
When a Neuron shits out a number more than some threshold number scientists say that the Neuron does fire here.
<br><br>
So everything you need to know about Neurons is that at some moment of time a Neuron is eating something in order then to shit out something.


<br><br>
<br><br>
We will just use this word Neuron since it is very poular in AI. Very soon you will understand what it means
<br><br>
So, first of all, we will take a close look at how exactly a Neuron works in Machine Learning.
<br><br>









The number the Main Formula gives out — the number <b>1</b> in our case — is called <b>Output</b> of the neuron.
<br><br>
Any neuron first receives something and then gives out something. Always.
<br><br>
So our neuron first receives those Inputs — 5, 3, 3 — and then gives out its Output — the number <b>1</b>.  
<!--
Here we are watching the work the smallest Neural Network consisting of one neuron. More big Neural Networks are built on the princple when there
-->

<br><br>
So the case that we have just examined:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="neuron.png" width= "80%">
</center>
<br>
might look like this:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="case_1.png" height= "100%">
</center>
<br>
Hopefully, you agree that it makes the representation of any Case both clear and short.
<br><br>
So we expect from our Neural Network that it will give out the following Output in each specific case:
<br><br>
<!--
So the fully completed table of <b>all possible Cases</b> according to your preferences look like this:
<br><br>
-->
<center>
<img src="table_allpr.png" height= "100%">
</center>
<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
Now, if wanted, you can <b>manually</b> calculate Output for each Case of 8 and you will see that our Neuron gives out those Outputs that we expect.
<br><br>
Just do it, if you want.
<br><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
So our Neuron gives out Outputs consistant with expected Outputs and
it means our Neuron works absolutely well. 
<br><br>
Our Neuron works absolutely well only because we got these right Multipliers (5, 5, -5) from someone. We were given these Multipliers.
<br><br>



In real life, we should calculate these Multipliers on our own. And very soon we will.
<br><br>

<!--
We used our simple Main Formula to see the way it works.


Also, in real life, there are some number of Neurons.

When we have some number Neurons it is called 
Presicecly, calculating Multipliers is called Maching Learning.
<br><br>
-->

Now, we're going to look at how our Neuron works in an automated way, diving in the code itself. It will be easy.
<!--
We're going to code this Artificial Brain.
<br><br>
Yes, let's code this Artificial Brain.

After you click the Run button, in the result — in the lower dark window — you will see the following text:
<br><br>
<img src="isthere0.png" height= "70%">
<br><br>
<br><br>
Please just use <b>3</b> as <b>yes</b> and <b>2</b> as <b>no</b>.
<br><br>
For example, type <b>3</b> like this:
<br><br>
<img src="isthere.png" height= "70%">
<br><br>
and then press the Enter button on the keyboard.
<br><br>
And you will see this:
<br><br>
<img src="iscocktail.png" height= "70%">
<br><br>


you may type the rest of Inputs this way. 
<br><br>
You may always type all Inputs this way. 


Now again, if wanted, you can play around with our AI, feeding diverse Inputs — of the table of the all possible cases — to it and getting various recommendations.
<br><br>
<b>See Explainations to Code</b>
<br><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
As we can see, everthing is easy and our AI works well.
<br><br>
Let's make our AI even better.
<br><br>
In order to really make our AI better we can do 2 things.
<br><br>
<b>The 1st thing to make our AI better</b>
<br><br>
Since the Output of our Main Formula changes by a <b>jump</b>  — is either equal to 0 or equal to 1:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="jump_fun.png" height= 350px>
</center>
<br>
this single fact, for some reasons, makes our AI less able to self-educating.
<br><br>
Indeed, having this Main Formula would make any AI less good to solving many of problems of the real world.
<br><br>
So, in reality, in the most cases, precisely this Main Formula is used:
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>1<br>
MainFormula = —————<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1 + 2.7<sup>&nbsp—&nbspSum</sup></b><br>
<br>
Or, if wanted, the same above formula may be represented either this way:
<br><br>
<b>MainFormula = 1 / (1 + 2.7<sup>&nbsp—&nbspSum</sup>)</b>
<br><br>
or this way:
<br><br>
<b>MainFormula = 1 / (1 + 2.7^(—&nbspSum))</b>
<br><br>
The chart of this Main Function looks this way:

<br><br>
<center>
<img src="sigmoid_fun.png" height= 400px>
</center>
<br>
Let’s consider how this Main Formula works for some specific Sums.
<br><br>
When Sum = 0<br>
MainFormula = 1 / (1 + 2.7<sup> — 0</sup>)<br>
Since 2.7<sup> — 0</sup> = 2.7<sup>0</sup> = 1 then:<br>
MainFormula = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1 / 2 = 0.5<br>
Exactly 0.5.<br>
<br>
When Sum = 6<br>
MainFormula = 1 / (1 + 2.7<sup> — 6</sup>)<br>
Since 2.7<sup> — 5</sup> ≈ 0.003 then:<br>
MainFormula ≈ 1 / (1 + 0.003) ≈ 1 / 1.003 ≈ 0.997<br>
Almost 1, a bit less than 1.<br>
<br>
When Sum = — 6<br>
MainFormula = 1 / (1 + 2.7<sup> — (— 6)</sup> = 1 / (1 + 2.7<sup>6</sup>)<br>
Since 2.7<sup>6</sup> ≈ 387 then:<br>
MainFormula ≈ 1 / (1 + 387) ≈ 1 / 388 ≈ 0.003<br>
Almost 0, a bit more than 0.<br>
<br><br>

The <b>2.7</b> in the Main Formula  represents the number <b>e</b>, known as Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.71828. So, actually, the Main Formula  may be represented this way:

<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>1<br>
MainFormula = —————————<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1 + 2.71828<sup>&nbsp—&nbspSum</sup></b><br>
<br>
or this way:
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>1<br>
MainFormula = —————————<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1 + e<sup>&nbsp—&nbspSum</sup></b><br>
<br>
So the 1st thing to make our AI better was to get the new Main Formula.
<br><br>
<b>The 2nd thing to make our AI better</b>
<br><br>
Working with Inputs, let's convert each <b>yes</b> into <b>3</b> and each <b>no</b> into <b>2</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="32.png" height= 150px>
</center>
<br>
Yes. It was easy!   if the
input is 0 the weights aren't adjusted !
<br><br>
The option with 1 and 0 was more bad since there was 0.
<br><br>
In reality, when <b>yes</b> is converted into 0 it makes process of self-educating for the AI sometimes impossible. 
<br><br>
For example, when at a party there isn't your best friend, there isn't your favorite cocktail and it isn't raining we expect from the AI that the recomendation will be to STAY home i.e. 0 (Case 7) -- but it will be impossible.
<br><br>
It will be impossible for our AI since when each of our Inputs is 0 the Multiplaers to these Inputs do not matter:<br>
Input1 * Multiplier1 = 0 * Multiplier1 = 0<br>
Input2 * Multiplier2 = 0 * Multiplier2 = 0<br>
Input3 * Multiplier3 = 0 * Multiplier3 = 0<br>

<br><br>
After all, we finally get our AI training:

<br><br>









<br><br>




With 
Чтобы данные можно было копировать -- таблица должна быть  в коде!!!
<br><br>
Now we should  CHANGE THE MAIN FORMULA IN THE CODE.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<pre>

 
import numpy as NiceTool
 
Input1 = str(input("Is there your best friend?\n"))
if Input1 == "yes":
   friend = 1
else:
   friend = 0
 
Input2 = str(input("Is there your favorite cocktail?\n"))
if Input2 == "yes":
   cocktail = 1
else:
   cocktail = 0
 
Input3 = str(input("Is it raining now?\n"))
if Input3 == "yes":
   rain = 1
else:
   rain = 0
 
Inputs = [friend, cocktail, rain]
print("All our Inputs: ", (Inputs))
 
Multipliers = [0.5, 0.5, -0.5]
print("All our Multipliers: ", (Multipliers))
 
Sum = NiceTool.dot(Inputs, Multipliers)
print("Our Sum: ", Sum)
 
print()
print("THE ROBOT’s RECOMMENDATION: ")
 
#   The Main Formula comes into play below:
 
if Sum >= 0.5:
    print("I'd like to recommend you to GO at the party, my host.")
else:
    print("I'd like to recommend you to STAY home, my host.")  


</pre>
<br><br>
See Explainations to Code!
<br><br>
First of all, we're gonna have to import numpy as Nice_Tool.
<br><br>
<b>import numpy as Nice_Tool</b>
<br><br>
Then we'll define the Main Formula:
<br><br>
def Main_Formula(self, Sum):
		if Sum >= 0.5:
          return 1
        else:
          return 0
<br><br>
So we already have the following code:
<br>
<pre>
<b>
import numpy as Nice_Tool


def Main_Formula(self, Sum):
		if Sum >= 0.5:
          return 1
        else:
          return 0
</b>
</pre>









<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
For other example, let's take the Case 2 that at a party there is your best friend, there isn't your favorite cocktail and it isn’t raining then we have the following:
<br><br>
bla

<fontHeading><center>The Way Computers See the World</center></fontHeading>
<font0>



People often say that computers love to work with numbers. It is true, computers love work with numbers.
<br><br>
But what exactly does it mean? How exactly computers work?
<br><br>
In reality, computers do not understand any numbers.
<br><br>
Everything a computer may understand is understand of if there is an electric current in some wire or not:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="is.png" height = 100px>
</center>
<br><br>
 Only this thing.
<br><br>
<!--
So, if there is an electric current in the wire the computer does one action and if not, the computer does other action. That is it.
<br><br>
-->
The case when there is an electric current in the wire is called  <b>1</b> (one) by people and the case when there is not an electric current in the wire is called <b>0</b> (zero):
<br><br>
<center><b>
101011000101</b>
</center>
<br>
Any sort of information that a computer understands and, respectively, gets is the information of if there is an electric current in some wire or not.
<br><br>
For example, any visual information that a computer gets from a camera, in reality, is the understanding by the computer of how many times <b>during some time</b> there was an electric current in some wire and how many times <b>during the same time</b> there wasn't an electric current in the same wire:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="signal.png" height = 200px>
</center>
<center><b>
0100010001111001111000010101010011111100010101001001</b>
</center>
<br>
Each case when there was an electric current in the wire is called <b>1</b> (one) and each case when there wasn't an electric current in the wire is called <b>0</b> (zero).
<br><br>
So, only thanks to the way computers see the world, some information of sound that a computer is getting from, say, a microphone can have the following look:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="mic.png" height = 200px>
</center>
<center><b>
101101001110000101010100111111000101010010011101010</b>
</center>
<br>
For now, you need to undestand that just for this reason people say that computers see any information only  as  a chain (sequence) of zeros and ones.
<br><br>
For example, below here  is a representation of the way computers see diverse human activities:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="activities.png" height = 300px>
</center>
<br><br>




So, for example, BLA BLA BLA
<br><br>


You can play aroind with our AI giving it different Inputs in each case.
<br><br>
It is one of ways how AI can work.
