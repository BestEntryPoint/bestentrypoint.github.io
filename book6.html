<fontHeading><center>Best Entry Point</center></fontHeading>
<div class="d"><br>
<font0>
We believe that the most hard thing in starting anything is to do the first step. We are here to make it easy.	
<br><br>
Hopefully, it is the first easily understandable book on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for girls and boys age 8+. Also, the best entry point for anyone who wants to start understanding AI.
<br><br>
By the way, we practice <b>redundancy</b> throughout this book, using very simple words and explaining the same things several times.

<fontHeading><center>What is AI?</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
Things are changing fast.
<br><br>
<center>

<br>
Probably, we are turning out into a world where wealth will be reduced to pure information, literally to <b>numbers</b>: such as 15 or 987, for example.
<br><br>

Where familiar things  — like buildings, lands, gold and state money — will not be valued the most any more.
<br><br>
It may be so since more and more people are starting to understand that the most valuable thing in the universe is only the ability to be limited — limited in the amount.
<br><br>
With keeping it in mind a virtual coin <b>Bitcoin</b> was created. The word <b>virtual</b> here means that this coin exists only in minds of the computers and we cannot even feel this coin by our hands, for example. 
<br><br>
Probably, Bitcoin is the most useful thing in the whole world, since — is really limited in the amount.
<br><br>
So probably, we are going to find themselves in a world where a thing that cannot be even felt will cost THE MOST. 
<br><br>
Where you can move your money freely, around the world, without needing any permission from anyone. Even, without needing your Identity Document.
<br><br>
Where no State can forcibly take away your money, i.e. your wealth.
<br><br>
In our opinion, we will enevatably be there. It is only a matter of time. Nearest time.
<br><br>
It all will happen thanks to crypto coins — cryptocurrencies. 



<!--
It is so since people around a world are finally starting to understand that the most valuable thing in the universe is only the ability to be limited — limited in the amount.
<br><br>
Not a single thing that in the whole universe is really limited, since it may be duplicated. Buildings may be built in a more amount. Gold may be mined more as well. Even land may be duplicated when colonization of Mars becomes reality.
<br><br>
Everything else may be duplicated but Bitcoin.

<fontHeading id="C4"><center>The point of cryptocurrencies</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
There is a mess of definitions describing what is a cryptocurrency.
<br><br>
A cryptocurrency is nothing else than such money, ownership of which is fully realized through knowing a secret number —  without needing any identity information — no real names, photos, handwritten signatures, residence addresses and the like things.
<br><br>
If a currency does not allow to do it then it is not a cryptocurrency. 
<br><br>
It is why Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and, for example, XRP coin is not.
<br><br>
</font0>

<fontHeading><center>Changing the Concept of Ownership</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
So a cryptocurrency allows for anyone to realize their ownership of it just through knowing a secret number.
<br><br>
For example, let's take Bitcoin.
<br><br>
So, Bitcoin is new money and, simultaneously, a new bank that <b>doesn’t need</b> your Identity Document and handwritten signature to allow you to move your money from you to anyone else.
<br><br>
But how exactly does it all work?
<br><br>
Interestingly, the answer is that everything depends on one assumption.
<br><br>	
On the assumption that a number of <b>1 with 77 zeros</b>:
<br><br>
<center><small>100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</small></center>
<br>
is a very big number.
<br><br>
Hahaha. It might even look funny and strange, at first sight, that  the whole concept of ownership of Bitcoin — literally multi-billion dollar fortunes in Bitcoin — would whenever depend on that assumption, but it is exactly so.
<br><br>
So people assume that this number -- <b>1 with 77 zeros</b>s --  is so big that
if each person on the planet secretly chooses their own number from this range -- any whole number  from 1 to <b>1 with 77 zeros</b> -- then it would be really impossible even for two people that their numbers would coincide. 
<br><br>
Of course, it is so if while choosing people want their numbers not to be guessed by others. Since in the most stupid case, a person might choose 1 or 2, for example, that might be easily guessed by others.
<br><br>

After all, if the assumption would turn out to be false then there would be a big problem for all the owners of Bitcoin. 
<br><br>
<center><big><b>If</b> !</big></center>
<br>
We will figure out why all the owners of Bitcoin in reality are completely safe.
<br><br>
First, we will try to understand how big is this number.
<br><br>

<!--
For now, without diving deep it would be useful to try to appreciate just how big this big number is.--> 

Some estimates for the number of grains of sand in the entire world are around seven quintillion:
<br><br>
<center>
<big><big><b>7 500 000 000 000 000 000</b></big></big><br>
grains of sand
</center>
<br>


Now, imagine that <b>every single grain</b> of sand represents an entire other
Earth of additional grains.
<br><br>
And now, just really try to imagine those lots of grains of sand.

<br><br>

<!--
<center>
<big><big><b>56 250 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000</b></big></big><br>
grains of sand
</center>
<br>
-->


Imagined them? 
<br><br>

Now again imagine that <b>every single grain</b> of those lots of grains of sand again represents an entire other Earth of additional grains.

<br><br>
Imagined them? 
<br><br>

And now again imagine that <b>every single grain</b> of those lots of grains of sand again represents an entire other Earth of additional grains.
<br><br>

Imagined them? 
<br><br>
So the number of all those grains of sand will still be much less than our big number, 1 with 77 zeros.

<br><br>








<!--
In order to get an idea of how big is this number, <b>1 with 77 zeros</b>:
<br><br>
<center><small>100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</small></center>
<br>
just note the following thing:
<br><br>
If we, for example, would count 1, 2, 3 … and would spend just one second to get to each next number, then it would take 5 seconds to count to 5.
<br><br>
Let’s try: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  So it has taken just 5 seconds.
<br><br>
But counting up to, for example, 1 trillion,  <b>1 with 12 zeros</b>:
<br><br>
<center><small>1000000000000</small></center>
<br>
would take already about 31 000 years. 31 000 YEARS!
<br><br>
Now it is the 2020th year.
<br><br>
The 2020 years equal 64 billion seconds that are 15 times less than 1 trillion seconds.
So we may say that throughout these long, long 2020 years we have lived just the time that is 15 times less than 1 trillion seconds:
<br><br>
<center>
<big><big><big><big><big><b>2020 years</b></big></big></big></big></big><br>
are 15 times less than 1 trillion seconds
</center>
<br>
We (authors) just want you to really feel how big is this number, <b>1 trillion</b>; and how big (long) is this time, <b>1 trillion seconds</b>.
<br><br>
Although, if we would count up to our very big number, <b>1 with 77 zeros</b>:
<br><br>
<center><small>100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</small></center>
<br>
then it would take<br><br>

<center><b>trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of YEARS!</b></center>
